# Warning: This is not a serious project
It's just my (maybe, I haven't decided yet) submission for the [Low Effort Jam 2 on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-2)
which was made in about 70 minutes.

Your task is to learn for an imaginary test and meanwhile try to survive.  
You'll need to eat, to sleep, to learn and to have fun.

There are tons of bugs and the code was made without much thought.
